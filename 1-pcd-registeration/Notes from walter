Steps for registeration:
    - ids for lidars
        - intersection is s110
        - highway is s40 and s50 (no data availabe for it)
    - local_terimal ws is ofr working locally 
        - ll src
        - build ws with catkinmk
        - sourvce the envorment
        - also there is python env. you will find the req.txt
        - change frame_id os_sensor
        - not important but to register three pcd 
            - use register_and_merge_ros_point_clouds
            _ or register_and_merge_pcd_point_clouds
        - registeration:
            - get intital transforamtion matrix ==> good results
            - cont. registeration (ICP)
            - inliner rsme
            -another method
             - is to estimate the intial trans matrix. 
                - it needs source, target, and voxel size (default is 2)
        - Calcuate Transformation matrix file is importent
